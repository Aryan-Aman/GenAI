-Open Source framework for developing applications powered by LLMs


#Why Langchain?
-System orchestration
-Concept of chains : modular components (like LLMs, prompt templates, memory, tools, etc.) that work together to achieve a complex task. Chains allow you to combine multiple steps of reasoning, API calls, and data processing into a structured pipeline. - No need to manually manage inputs/outputs. - One output is input for next chain.

-Model Agonstic development : Can use GCP/AWS/AZURE/onprem or Any Openai/Claude/llama any 

-Complete Ecosystem : Any text splitter, any embedding, any llm

-Memory and State Handling : Memory stores conversation history or important data across multiple interactions. Unlike traditional stateless API calls, LangChain enables LLMs to retain context.
State handling refers to managing variables (e.g., user preferences, previous messages, or external data) persistently across multiple runs of a chain.
