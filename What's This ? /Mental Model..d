# FOUNDATION MODELS: 
-generalized models-can perform many tasks -bcz too much data fed, many parameters etc.- eg LLMs 

# GEN AI - divided into two parts Either build foundation models (Builder Perspective) or use foundation models (User Perspective).


User_Perspective : Prompt Engineering,  RAG (Document chat), AI Agents, Vector Databases, Fine Tuning 

Builder Perspective : RLHF(Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback)-can be used to modify LLM behaviour used in building LLM, Pretraining (data given to train) , Quantization(Optimization of LLMs) , Fine Tuning
