User_Perspective : Prompt Engineering,  RAG (Document chat), AI Agents, Vector Databases, Fine Tuning 

Builder Perspective : RLHF(Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback)-can be used to modify LLM behaviour used in building LLM, Pretraining (data given to train) , Quantization(Optimization of LLMs) , Fine Tuning
